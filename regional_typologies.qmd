## Agenda

1.  Understanding the Regional Typologies
2.  Methodology and Steps
3.  Case Studies and Examples
4.  Closing Remarks

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What are Regional Typologies?

-   **Definition**
    -   A categorization of geographical areas based on shared features.
    -   Features often include quantifiable socio-economic indicators and environmental factors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why are Regional Typologies Useful?

-   Regions vary in socio-economic and environmental aspects.
-   Typologies group regions with similar characteristics, making them more manageable.
-   They facilitate comparisons and targeted management.

| Criteria                  | Regional Typologies                                                                                 | Regional Indexes                                                                          |
|------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| **What it is**            | Categorises areas based on similar socio-economic, environmental, or institutional characteristics. | A single, composite measure that quantifies the level of vulnerability to a threat.       |
| **Outcome**               | Classifications like "urban area" or "rural area."                                                  | Numerical score ranking areas from low to high vulnerability.                             |
| **Use-case**              | Tailoring policies or interventions to different types of areas.                                    | Prioritising aid, resources, or interventions based on the ranking                        |
| **Caveats**               | Can oversimplify complexities; subject to analyst bias.                                             | May not capture the full situation; choice of indicators and weightings can be arbitrary. |
| **Complementary aspects** | Provides rich, contextual information.                                                              | Pinpoints areas needing immediate attention.                                              |

**Assessing and Characterizing Climate Vulnerabilities in Agriculture-Based Livelihoods: South Sulawesi**
:::

::: {.panel-tabset style="font-size:16px"}
### Map

### **1. Islands**

-   The second lowest household density after rural areas.

-   Limited accessibility to land-based livelihoods.

-   Economy predominantly relies on marine resources and maritime transport.

-   Inadequate health, education facilities, and market access.

-   Driest area in South Sulawesi with potential freshwater scarcity.

-   High drought indices with significant predicted rainfall decrease.

-   Over 40% of the population is underprivileged.

-   Mostly situated in warm lowlands; a 1°C temperature rise could be impactful.

### **2. Predominantly Rural & Biodiversity Rich**

-   Rural areas in South Sulawesi with the lowest household density.

-   Mountainous regions overlapping with protected areas, last bastions of unique Wallacean biodiversity.

-   High rainfall, low drought vulnerability (AI = 0.3).

-   In close proximity to forests, deforestation sites, and areas previously affected by fires.

-   Furthest from plantation concessions and limited road and river access.

-   Minimal changes in rainfall but the highest rate of temperature increase.

-   Highest erosion risk; lowest flood risk.

-   Almost 50% of the population falls in the bottom 40% economic bracket.

### **3. Predominantly Plantation-Driven Economy**

-   Closest to plantations, forests, and deforestation sites.

-   Furthest from previously burned areas in Sulawesi.

-   Medium household density per sub-district.

-   Moderate flood risk.

-   Moderate extent of irrigation.

-   Second highest risk of erosion and landslides after inland areas.

-   Highest rate of deforestation.

-   High risk of rainfall reduction, though not classified as arid.

-   About 1/3 of the population falls in the bottom 40% economic bracket.

### **4. Food Basket**

-   Highest arable land coverage, with predominant irrigated areas.

-   Highest smallholder land ownership.

-   Second closest proximity to burned areas after urban regions.

-   Second highest access to roads and rivers following urban areas.

-   Second highest household density per district after urban regions; similar trend observed in health and education facilities.

-   Least proximity to forests due to limited forest cover.

-   Primarily located in lowlands; a temperature rise of 1.41°C significantly impacts this already warm region.

-   Expected to experience the most significant rainfall decrease (-84.31 mm) among typologies, making it the most drought-prone.

-   Flood risks during the rainy season, aggravated by minimal remaining forest cover.

-   High household density, with over a third belonging to the bottom 40% economic bracket.

### **5. Predominantly Industry & Service-Driven Economy**

-   Smallest area coverage (3%) with least arable land.

-   Lowest smallholder land ownership, following island regions.

-   Second closest proximity to burned areas after semi-urban regions.

-   Best access to roads and rivers.

-   Highest household density per district.

-   Easy access to health facilities, supermarkets, universities, and hospitals. However, each unit caters to a large number of households.

-   Only 15.1% of households fall within the bottom 40% economic bracket.

-   Warmest current temperatures compared to other regions; a rise of 1.43°C significantly impacts underprivileged local residents.

-   High flood risk, given many urban areas are near rivers.

-   Heavily reliant on food supplies from other regions.
